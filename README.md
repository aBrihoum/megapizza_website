This project is a lite version of a website, I designed and coded from the ground up for the largest fast-food restaurant chain in Algeria üá©üáø : `Mega Pizza`.

This project is made with the help of :

- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [lightGallery](https://www.lightgalleryjs.com/)
- [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/)
- [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes)

## Preview

Thanks to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), you can preview the website online

## Road

The most challenging and time-consuming part of this project is the design. No pattern nor road/information/picture/color/design was given to me. I was told to : `Make A Website` period. Because of that :

- I've spent days, imagining, designing, re-imagining, re-designing, searching, seeking inspiration, testing color palettes, backgrounds, searching for SVGs, icons, editing & creating custom banners/images compressing them...

Coding the website was fun, but optimizing it not that much, like you may know, `Angular` is famous with its big bundle size, and I can't sleep at night if a website I build has a bad [lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) score. Because of that, hours were spent trying to get the perfect score & the perfect UX, and I eventually got there by essentially lazy loading and preloading a bunch of the website resources and prioritizing them from first to last to load. Something that also helped is the use of the `webP` image format.

This website is super responsive, I made sure of that by checking every possible view-port.
The minimum width this website support is `280px` (Galaxy Fold 1).

#### Why angular ?

You may say that the website is simple enough to just use vanilla JavaScript, and yes, you are right, but like I already mentioned, this version is a `lite` version, the original one was supposed to have ton of features, like ordering online and having a realtime status of the latter, sharing thoughts and leaving reviews, a discount program, a mobile application...
